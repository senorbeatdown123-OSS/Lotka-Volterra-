In this project, we are trying to create an interactive graph of how predator and prey influence each  other's populations and growth rates. This 'interactivity' is achieved by sliders ( added by virtue of matplotlib)
for the different constants in the lotka volterra predator prey model which are a pair  of nonlinear differential equations which strictly show oscillatory motion.
